				Title: ALUMNI ALLIANCE.<br/>
				Technology Used: ANDROID.
				Description: In this project, I have create an android application for alumni of the college, so that they can  interact with the college mates and can share the knowledge about job opportunities, projects they are working on and trends in the company. By this, students can become professional in earlier and acquire knowledge about the working conditions.     <br/>

				Title: ALERT JOURNEY. <br/>
				Technology Used: ANDROID.
				Description: In this project, I have created an interface that will take destination(place) as an input from user and gets the latitude and longitude of that place using GPRS dynamically. As usually the application will generate the latitude and longitude of current position using the same technique. Using this data we can find distance between two places through some mathematical equations and the application will automatically trigger alarm when the destination is 2 km farther. This is useful for all the travellers as a reminder.
